# Covid19-detection-using-ct-scan-and-chest-x-rays-with-DL
Covid 19 detection using CT scans and chest Xrays with deep learning.
COVID-19 Detection based on Chest X-rays and CT Scans using transfr learning - InceptionV3.
The model were trained for 500 epochs on around 1000 Chest X-rays and around 750 CT Scan images on Google Colab GPU.
After training, the accuracy acheived for the model is like:              
InceptionV3 
Chest X-rays    96%       

CT Scans        93%  

The dataset for the project was gathered from two sources:

Chest X-ray images (1000 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
CT Scan images (750 images) were obtained from: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT/tree/master/Data-split 80% of the images were used for training the models and the remaining 20% for testing
